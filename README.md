UCSD CSE 124 Fall 2017 Homework 1 starter code

The examples/ directory contains some example inputs--these files have already
been modified so that each line ends in CRLF.

There is a tools/ directory which contains a script that prints out
information about whether the file you're modifying already has
lines which end in CRLF or not.  It also includes a script that will
convert a file in UNIX format into one that ends lines in CRLF.
